// actually its kind of trickyone cause its look simple but when u see clearly the subarray count every possible isnoted in 'a' then make a count by adding and again that makes value higher
if the sub length is 2 then first cnt is 1 and a  = 1 after cntis 2 then a aledy 1 now 3 so the one one two these probabilities satisfied here
